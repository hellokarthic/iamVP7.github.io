<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;"><a href="http://technorulerin.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/7388e-final.png" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/7388e-final.png" height="320" width="256" /></a>Previous <a href="http://technoruler.blogspot.in/2014/07/utility-components-for-appmaker-for.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> we have seen what are the different components or bricks in Utility. The Utility components are awesome to build large number of interesting Firefox OS applications.</p>
<p>In our application we are first going to use some of Utility components in our next app we can use others. The components are 
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>Header</li>
<li>Image</li>
<li>
<div id="stcpDiv" style="left:-1988px;position:absolute;top:-1999px;">Button With Confirmation
<div id="stcpDiv" style="left:-1988px;position:absolute;top:-1999px;">Button With Confirmation</div>
</div>
<p>Button with Conformation</li>
<li>Text box</li>
<li>Text Input with Button</li>
</ul>
<p>We already knew that <b>Header</b> is very Important for almost all the application. So we have Started with header and named it as <b>We are Good</b>. It is very well know all Mozillians are best and Good in contribution. </p>
<p>Below that we have placed the <b>Image</b>. As of now we have not given the source. So at first it will appear blank. We will get the image in future. Surely it is well know image.  Increase the height according to your need.</p>
<p>Below that is <b>Text Input with Button</b>.  The input which we give in the text box will go as output.</p>
<p>Placed a simple<b> text box</b>. With the instruction. The instruction is given in the Text area and the colour of the text is red you can change it to any <br />"Click Start You will get image by clicking Submit"</p>
<p><a href="http://technorulerin.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/a4f69-first.png" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/a4f69-first.png" height="320" width="256" /></a>Below the Text box we have placed with <b>Button with Conformation</b> with the Label <i>Click and Start</i> and Conformation message as <i>Shall We start. </i>As of now didn't change the colour of button. Then the value which will be set is the Image source path.</p>
<p>The flow of the application is also follows. The user is requested first to click on the Button with Conformation. A pop-up will come. If he accepts then the value is sent to the Text Input with Button. When he hits Submit the output will be going to Image, the output is Image source and it will be displayed.</p>
