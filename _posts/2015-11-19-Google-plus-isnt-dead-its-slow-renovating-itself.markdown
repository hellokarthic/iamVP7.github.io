They are making lit of changes and bring more advancements to Google photos so more and more love it and actively use it.

Google also removed Google+ comments for YouTube which many YouTube lovers love so much.  After these changes there we not many changes with Google+, a week back Google+ introduced a small service to displayed your profile. We have also checked it at [aboutme](https://aboutme.google.com/).

A day back Google in its blog said about the major change coming to Google+ in upcoming days. It is mainly update for UI change and separating the most used components. From beginning Google+ search was fixed at top and we have to scroll to top which was harder, with its new UI it is changing lot of things.

In 2012 Google launched communities which was more similar to what they had in Orkut, from then 1.2 M people were actively using these things to share their views with common interested people.
