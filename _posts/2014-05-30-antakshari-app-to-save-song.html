<div style="text-align:justify;">Most of the Indian should be knowing about the title very well. Yes the olden days are back but it has now become somewhat digital. It was the golden time when we had such an event happening around us with lot of joy and enjoyment. We all were happy and had great time.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Before starting for those who are not aware of what the Title is here is some small description.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">ANTAKSHARI it is one of the common games in olden days where a group of people will be playing. We are in need of atleast 2 people but the maximum number can be any. Sometimes they used to play in group also. The group game will be very awesome lot of team work and the game goes for long time.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Here first one will be starting to sing the song then after that at the end of the song with the last character another team will be starting to sing the song. And the game of singing goes on sometime for the whole day. No one will get bored to play this game. They will be always enjoying to play it. It is really a coolest game than anything.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">But some difficulties are faced when we play the game we may not suddenly remember the start of many songs and so we may lose the points. So we are  in position to save the songs list we would like to have. But making it as a simple notes will be very difficult, for eliminating this difficulty we have found a mobile application for android.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">There are currently 4 mobile applications in Indian languages for this feature.</div>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wordpress.arogyavidya.antaksharimarathi">Antakshari Marathi </a></li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wordpress.arogyavidya.antaksharicheat">ANTAKSHARI CHEAT</a></li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wordpress.arogyavidya.antaksharibengali">Antakshari Bengali</a></li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wordpress.arogyavidya.pattukkupattu">PATTUKU PATTU</a></li>
</ul>
<div>The description from the developer is as follows</div>
<div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="border:0;margin-bottom:5px;padding:0;"><span style="font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">This application is for those who play or participate in antakshari programs.</span>It has the simplest UI. Start input from the opening screen and building your collection of songs.<br />From the same screen, search for the songs. Use any field or column with minimal input to search. Select one from list to edit or use in your program.<br />It is totally FREE.<br />Seat the youngsters at the rear with a phone and this app. They can search and prompt within no time.<br />It is fun to have this and beat your opponents with eyes closed (Keep the ears open).<br />Use anysoft keyboard or any other suitable keyboard for input. You can use transliteration i.e use English alphabets instead of Tamil. Or the input can be in English.<br />Try and see the results.</p></blockquote>

<div style="text-align:justify;">The application is well designed. It mandatory inputs are first character and the first word. Other inputs are singer name, movie name, actors the year of release. </div>
</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">You can search the songs with first character or the first word. We have talked to the developer regarding the english version of the application to support world wide. It is expected to be released very soon. </div>
</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">And in the next update there are lot of changes like once the song is saved he will be allowed to share it in the social networks like Google+ and Facebook.
