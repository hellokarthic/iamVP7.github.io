As of September 8th 2016, we are currently having 4 experiments in Testpilot

- [No More 404s](http://bit.ly/No404)
- [Activity Stream](http://bit.ly/FxAcSt)
- [Tab Center](http://bit.ly/FxTpTc)
- [Universal Search](http://bit.ly/FxTpUs)


All these 4 experiments have their own pros when we use it. For example I love Universal Search very much, it is very helpful and reduces my time in searching particular pervious visited websites in my machine. Activity Stream gives beautiful visual treat of the websites I have visited, shared top viewed websites and so on. More information about these Experiments are shared by [MozillaTN](http://mozillatn.github.io) community members as blog posts

Now for Example lets Enable Universal Search.

- Visit [Universal Search](http://bit.ly/FxTpUs) page
