<p>Recently Mozilla has announced new Plan for search default search engine in their browser. Search is one of the most important action made by each and every user who uses internet. Firefox Users alone make near 100 billion search per year.</p>
<p>Since 2004 till November 2014 Google was the default search engine in Firefox. Firefox is pre-installed and many Linux based operating system. So due to this <a title="Interesting Week for Google" href="http://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2014/12/12/interesting-week-for-google/">Google enjoyed</a> large number of search to its browser. Mozilla renewed new options giving wide options to benefit the users.</p>

<p>In USA yahoo has become default search engine, Yandex Search  in Russia, Baidu in China and along with them we will be having some more search engines like Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo and so on. Google is default search engine for most part of the world.</p>
<p>This big jump made Google to lose some of its share in Search while yahoo is earning bit more number of search queries. For Google Search is the only big business from which is earns lot of profit. When it has some decrease in this then it will be very sad for Google.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Google has <a title="Android Studio" href="http://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/android-studio/" target="_blank">Android OS</a> based devices which is having a default search engine as Google, and <a title="Gmail Team redirects using to Inbox Webclient" href="http://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2014/12/20/gmail-team-redirects-using-to-inbox-webclient/" target="_blank">Gmail</a> has search, drive almost each and every Google products like drive, <a title="Awesome New Google+ notification Icon" href="http://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2014/12/20/awesome-new-google-notification-icon/" target="_blank">Google+</a>, <a title="Google வரைபடத்தில் உங்கள் வீட்டை(Google Mapmaker)" href="http://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/google-%e0%ae%b5%e0%ae%b0%e0%af%88%e0%ae%aa%e0%ae%9f%e0%ae%a4%e0%af%8d%e0%ae%a4%e0%ae%bf%e0%ae%b2%e0%af%8d-%e0%ae%89%e0%ae%99%e0%af%8d%e0%ae%95%e0%ae%b3%e0%af%8d-%e0%ae%b5%e0%af%80%e0%ae%9f%e0%af%8d/" target="_blank">maps</a>, <a title="Blogger Gadgets" href="http://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2013/01/15/blogger-gadgets/" target="_blank">blogger</a> and so on has lot of search capabilities. It has still lot of opportunities to earn more. Google will be surely coming with lot of plans even when it is down. Google is yet awesome.</p>
