<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">
<div style="text-align:justify;">Wow... The title of this blog post is remembering you the old Game which you used to try it in your last pages of your note book. Yes this blog post is all about that only.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:justify;"><a href="http://technorulerin.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/890e2-unnamed2-webp.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/890e2-unnamed2-webp.jpg" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Why this game is so popular. It is because most of the boys try it openly and say about it to other boys and at the same time girls try it and have it secretly. They wanted to know what is the exact relationship between them and another person. The most interesting things will come when we try to get the relationship about two persons who are our enemies and who is not that impressive and hated by all in the class room. This is always fun!!!</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Lets us see how to play this game. </div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">There will be two text boxes. The user needs to give 2 names which he/she would be interested. Then you will be clicking the submit button. Then the background algorithm will be checking about the names and then finally it will be tell what is the relation among both the users. To expand the game name look below</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:left;"></div>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li style="text-align:justify;">F-FRIEND</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">L-LOVE</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">A-AFFECTION</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">M-MARRIAGE</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">E-ENEMY</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">S-SISTER</li>
</ul>
<p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">We have lot of fun in this game. The game which is being discussed here has lot of new things lined up. The most exciting thing in whenever I get the result, in olden days it was only the text result but in this application I am excited to see Images as the result. Another notable thing to be share regarding this application is each and every time we will be getting different images. There are large number of images for each and every relation.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Exciting features of this application</div>
<p>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li style="text-align:justify;">CLASSIC GAME</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">RANDOM IMAGES FOR EACH RELATION</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">SOUNDS</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align:justify;">You can find this application in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blackcorp.flames">Google Play Store</a>. But by the end of this week we can find the same exciting application in different platforms. </div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">In future the expected update is that there will be calculations based on Chinese zodiac and the how much influence each and every relation will be having instead of telling about only one relationship.</div>
</div>
