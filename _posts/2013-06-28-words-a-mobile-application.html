<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Recently I have found interest in developing mobile applications. I loved Firefox OS to the core and had a great passion to develop applications for that mobile platform. It is using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://technorulerin.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/f5b1a-icon-256.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/f5b1a-icon-256.png?w=256" height="200" width="200" /></a></div>

<p>When ever we use HTML5 technologies it is always cool. We can do a lot of things there. So I spent some time in that and learnt to some extent how to develop mobile application for Firefox OS.</p>
<p>It was pretty easy to learn. All the resources are available in Mozilla Developers Network. It is really a great place to learn web technologies.</p>
<p>After finish my application I came to know about the power of HTML5. Yes it is really great. I have developed code only once but I am available to use the same for the mobile applications and then for desktop applications and so on. It is really good to know that <b><i>write once and deploy many.</i></b><br /><b><i><br /></i></b>Currently you can find this mobile application in Firefox Market place and then in Ubuntu Software center.</p>
<p>You can login the respective market place and download it. Right now I have 100 downloads in Ubuntu Software Center and only 1 download in Firefox OS. The application is absolutely free of cost.<br />You can ping me and get the source code and can download from github.</p>
<p><b>Future Expectation:</b>Very soon this mobile application will be developed to the platforms like Blackberry, Android, and Windows mobile market.</div>
