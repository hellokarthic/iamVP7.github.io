<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Mozilla Appmaker making it easier for lot of the thing which we would like to make it in the internet and according to our own design and graphics. In this blog post you will be learning to create a mobile application for Firefox OS or a web app which can be viewed in our browser itself.</p>
<p>Here I would like to share with you the application which has been developed by me with the help of the appmaker tools. The basic idea is to share a message to the winner so he can feel happy.</p>
<p>The basic layout which  was made for developing this application is that it should have a text area, then an image which looks catchy and then some space and a button. So when he clicks the button we can display the message.</p>
<p>According to the Appmaker technical terms the most important components required are as follows,</p>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>Text area or Header (1)</li>
<li>Image (1)</li>
<li>Spacer(2)</li>
<li>Button(1)</li>
</ul>
<div><b>Steps for designing</b></div>
<div>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>The first step is to give the name for the application. You can click on the unnamed app and dialog comes and in that text box we need to give our desired name.</li>
<li>The first thing is to place the header (we dont need any text now, so give the Header label a space alone)</li>
<li>Then place the image box, and give the source of the image you want.</li>
<li>Then place 2 spacer so you will be getting bigger and enough space.</li>
<li>Then place the button give the Label name you want, then the Value you want so when you click it will be made to added to the header, if needed change the color of the text and color of the button.</li>
</ul>
<div></div>
</div>
<p><b>Designing the action</b></p>
<ul style="text-align:left;">
<li>Click the button, you will be seeing the arrow in the right side. Click on that and choose the color.</li>
<li>Then Click the Header, the arrow will be in left side click the select the required.</li>
<li>Then hit the publish button by selecting the 2nd drop down.</li>
</ul>
