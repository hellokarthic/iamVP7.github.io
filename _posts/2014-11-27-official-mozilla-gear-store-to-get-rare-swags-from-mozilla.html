<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Everyone loves to get swag from organisation all over the world. Usually they are given to encourage more contributors and the technology lovers. Mozilla Swags are very easy to get but only thing is we need to do small contribution. If we do contribution without seeing anything other than that then everything automatically comes. But some of us don't find enough time to contribute to open source project but we need gear.</p>
