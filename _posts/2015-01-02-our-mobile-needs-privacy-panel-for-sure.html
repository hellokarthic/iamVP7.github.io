<p>I have been fan of Mozilla Firefox for one of most important reason, because it will protect my privacy. Ya I don't love to give my information on internet much. I love real time communication and prefer to give my details to the people whom i have closely interacted instead of giving it to Internet Giants.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_337" align="alignright" width="199"]<a href="https://technorulerin.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/2015-01-01-03-42-55.png"><img class=" wp-image-337" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015-01-01-03-42-55.png?w=169" alt="Privacy Control application is shield for our Mobile" width="199" height="355" /></a> Shield is our Privacy Control app[/caption]</p>
<p>Now the world is Moving towards Mobile. Each and everything a small bit of information is transmitted through mobile, the important information which should not be released is our current location, but the mobile phone is having lot of capability to share everything. Each and every app can track our information and it can easily sell the information when we use the application either in our mobile or even as webapps.</p>
<p>To control such information Sharing Latest Mozilla Firefox OS has lot of ways to do it. One among them was Privacy Panel application which will be available soon on Firefox OS 2.2. Since I love to update my developer device I learn and see lot of new things on my device daily.</p>
<p><em>Why this application is meant for ?</em></p>
<p>Lot of mobile applications wants us to give our geolocation details. Most of the cases we don't love to give our geolocation details. During such time this application will be very useful. We can easily set our location which is around 50 miles so we dont give our exact details but we can get updates around us.</p>
<p>We can set custom location. Say if you love to update your status from San Francisco, California but you are in Europe or India you can do with this. You can do this for each and every app. So update your Facebook status from SFO, tweet from Europe and share image from India. ;)</p>
<p>Remote Privacy Protection</p>
<p>You can easily set your personal pass phrase. It will be very helpful when your phone is stolen. We can easily get our latitude and longitude of our phone. To do so we simply has to send an sms "RPP locate OURPassPhase" to our number.</p>
<p>To Ring our phone we simply have to use send an sms "RPP ring OURPassPhase" to our number.</p>
<p>To Lock our phone we simply have to use send an sms "RPP lock OURPassPhase" to our number.</p>
