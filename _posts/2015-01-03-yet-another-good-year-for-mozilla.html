<p>India is one of most awesome market. Here there are billion people with lot of dreams. It is really a huge consumer market compared to others.

The main mission of bringing next billion users online has been supported by Firefox OS.</p>
<p><strong>Firefox Hello Preview</strong></p>
<p>Video calling is one of the most awesome tool which we use in our date to day life. When we can include it with browser itself then need for third party apps will get reduced. Firefox hello preview has been released in this october, It is based on Real time Web RTC. We can easily talk with our friends with this.</p>

<p>Firefox celebrated its 10th birthday this November. It was a big treat for the developers, for its birthday <a href="http://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2014/11/10/firefox-introduced-developer-edition-of-browser/" target="_blank">Firefox Developer edition</a> came.
