<p style="text-align:justify;">Firefox 2.0 is considered to be most awesome mobile OS which has very good UI. It made many developers to start moving to <a href="https://affiliates.mozilla.org/referral/72938/" target="_blank">Firefox OS</a> 2.0 in their developer device.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Recently I came across Firefox OS 2.2 in Mozilla developer Network. I had the aim to check how it is after seeing Firefox OS 2.0 UI I understood 2.2 UI will be very awesome. Thank god I didn't get cheated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The biggest mistake which I have done when install Firefox 2.0 from Firefox OS 1.3 which is by default coming in Mozilla Flame is without install the base image (Firefox 2.0 v 188) I did, so I was not able to access the mobile for few minutes.  Then I understand I have to install base image first above that I have to i<img class="alignright wp-image-337 size-medium" title="Firefox OS 2.2 Compact UI" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2015-01-01-03-42-55.png?w=169" alt="Compact UI" width="169" height="300" />nstall Firefox OS 2.2. Successfully I have done it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Very Compact UI</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firefox OS 2.2 has a very good feature where we can have very compact grouping of icons.  As you can see the image there are two sets of icons, the first two row of the icons are very small and the third row is bigger in size. The reason behind this is the first two icons sets are minimized while the third row has been maximized. The is very awesome concept for those who will be having larget number of apps in their daily use. The another aim of this may be is to avoid over scrolling in the screen. This will be for sure one of the game changer for the Firefox OS which it comes to production.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Apps Switching</em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">App switching in Firefox OS 2.2 has now becomes simpler and very easier. Now to close the application we can simply swipe from bottom to top or else we can simply press the X (Close) button which is found now in the left bottom. Previously we had the close button in the left top and which is also smaller and was difficult to use. Now it has become very much easier. The transition when tapping from Left to Right or Right to Left is very awesome compared to before. This transition is also smooth and the best UX research is done here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>New Feature Introduced</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mozilla is standing out in implementing lot of security related tools. No one can match them. They are the best in that domain and helping people to know more about privacy. To deal with this Firefox OS 2.2 has new application coming along with the OS itself. The more about this mobile application will be discussed in future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude UI and UX part of Firefox OS 2.2 is awesome. It is really going to become a good game changer.</p>
