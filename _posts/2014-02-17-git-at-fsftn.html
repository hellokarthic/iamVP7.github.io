<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">This is my second day visiting to FSFTN(Free Software Foundation Tamil Nadu). Here a team of people helping college students to teach about open source technologies and helping with the final semester project. Not only Final semester students, any one who have interest to learn about Open source can get help from FSFTN.</p>
<p>On my previous visit to FSFTN I was discussing about my final semester project. What I found is that I have not studied well how my project will be  very helpful for this community. I really left bad, so I am planning to think differently and start doing things which helps everyone.</p>
<p>I was discussing about the list of projects FSFTN is currently involved. And I found <b>Spell Checker for Tamil</b> to be interesting.</p>
<p>I started a simple discussion that what happen when I change the list of english words to tamil words so the spell checker is done. But I found there are some complexity with the language.</p>
<p>Then I was reading some technical papers about the spell check.</p>
<p>Then On my second day I was taught how to use github. It was very informative session. Previously I have used github but the session was bit interesting to learn from good tutor.</p>
<p>That time learnt a lot from interaction. I have discussed about the Tamil Spell Checker project and got the contact of other two mentors who are using python in day to day life.</p>
