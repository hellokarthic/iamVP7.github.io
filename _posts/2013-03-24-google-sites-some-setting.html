<p>To change the name of site which is appearing on the tab you have change in the <b>Site name</b> text box. So what is in that text box will appear in the top.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><b>Site description </b><br />This will help to during SEO of website. When you give in detail about your website then search engines can easily know about your website and can index them.</p>
<p><b>Mature content</b><br /><b> </b>Please see whether you website is having any content for adults if yes please check the box. If it is not there kindly don't check. If it is personal website then you should not have them. It will reduce your viewers .</p>
