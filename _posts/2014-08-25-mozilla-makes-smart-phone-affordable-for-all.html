<p>To break this barrier and enable everyone to use internet, Mozilla corporation started a new project for Mobile Operating system. This Mobile OS is named as Firefox OS. This OS is fully developed with the help of the Web technologies. The User Interface which we see is developed and apps are made up of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/web/Guide/HTML/HTML5" target="_blank">HTML5</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank">CSS3</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">Javascript</a>.</p>
<p><b>LinuxÂ </b><br />The main reason for making it affordable is using Linux. We all knew Linux is a open source kernel and we can change according to our need.</p>
<p><b>Why Web technologies</b><br />The main reason for Web technologies is that it does not require high end hardware to process them. So it was very easy for device manufactures to use simple hardware for using the OS and give their best.</p>
<p>Many apps which we need to develop does not need much hardware and it also dont need much memory space also. What the user interface is seen in Android or iOS we can easily bring here using CSS3 technologies. We need not use complex image editing software to do it.</p>
<p>And also for data manipulation is done with the help of Javascript. To run CSS3 or Javascript we dont need very big hardware we can easily run it with the help of simple browsers. The same concept is adapted in Firefox OS also.</p>
<p><b>Development</b><br />The Operating System is not developed only by Mozilla employees but it is also written with Love by many contributors all over the world. Which is fully developed using Web technologies. The lower level i.e., Kernal level is developed using C.</p>
<p>We have more to know about Firefox OS</p></div>
