<p><b><br /></b><b><span id="goog_209600982"></span><span id="goog_209600983"></span><br /></b><b>Divisibility by 2</b><br />A number is divisible by ‘2’ if it ends in zero or in a digit which is a multiple of ‘2’i.e. 2,4, 6, 8.<br />Example: 90,66</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 3</b><br />A number is divisible by ‘3’, if the sum of the digits is divisible by ‘3’.<br />Example: 66.<br />6+6 = 12 = 1+2 =3<br /><a name="more"></a><b>Divisibility by 4</b><br />A number is divisible by ‘4’ if the number formed by the last two digits.<br />Example 6788<br />take 88 it is divisible by 4</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 5</b><br />A number is divisible by ‘5’ if it ends in zero or 5<br />Example: 635, 980</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 6</b><br />A number is divisible by ‘6’ if it divisible by ‘2’ as well as by ‘3’.<br />Example: 84.<br />4 is last digit so it is divisible by 2<br />8 + 4 = 12 = 1+2 = 3</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 7</b><br />Subtract 2 times the last digit from remaining truncated number. Repeat the step as necessary. If the result is divisible by 7, the original number is also divisible by 7<br />Example: 784.<br />78- (4 *2) = 78-8 = 70 is divisible by 7</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 8</b><br />A number is divisible by ‘8’ if the number formed by the last three digits, i.e,hundreds tens and units is divisible by ‘8’.<br />Example:9784<br />Consider 784</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 9</b><br />A number is divisible by ‘9’ if the sum of its digit is divisible by ‘9’ or sum is equal to 9.<br />Example: 8973<br />8+9+7+3 = 27 = 2+ 7 =9</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 10</b><br />A number is divisible by ‘10’ if it ends in zero.<br />Example: 60,780</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 11</b><br />A number is divisible by ‘11’ if the difference between the sums of the digits in the even and odd places is zero or a multiple of ‘11’<br />3729 = ( (7+9) - (2+3)) = (16 - 5) = 11 so OK</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 12</b><br />A number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 4 and 3.<br />Example: 1212<br />1+2+1+2= 6 is divisible by 3<br />12 is divisible by 4</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by  13<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;"> </span></b><br />Add 4 times the last digit to the remaining truncated number. Repeat the step as necessary. If the result is divisible by 13, the original number is also divisible by 13.<br />Example: 169 is divisible by 13<br />9 * 4 = 36.<br />36 + 16 = 52 which is divisible by 13</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 14</b><br />If a number is divisible by 2 as well as 7.<br />Example 784.<br />4 is divisible by 2.<br />78- (4 *2) = 78-8 = 70 is divisible by 7</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 15</b><br />If a number is divisible by both 3 &amp; 5.<br />Example is 225.<br />2+2+5 = 9 is divisible by 3</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 17<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;"> </span></b><br />Subtract 5 times the last digit from remaining truncated number. Repeat the step as necessary. If the result is divisible by 17, the original number is also divisible by 17.</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 18</b><br />If a number is divisible by both 2 &amp; 9.<br />108 is divisible by 18.<br />1+0+8 = 9 is divisible by 9.<br />8 is divisible by 2<br /><b><br /></b><b>Divisibility by 19</b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;"> </span><br />Add 2 times the last digit to the remaining truncated number. Repeat the step as necessary. If the result is divisible by 19, the original number is also divisible by 19.<br />Example: 95.<br /> 9 + (2 * 5) =  19 is divisible by 19</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 21</b><br />If a number is divisible by both 3 &amp; 7.<br />Example is 84</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 23<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;"> </span></b><br />Add 7 times the last digit to the remaining truncated number. Repeat the step as necessary. If the result is divisible by 23, the original number is also divisible by 23.<br />Example is 115.<br />11+(7*5) = 46<br /><b><br /></b><b>Divisibility by 24</b><br />If a number is divisible by both 3 &amp; 8.</p>
<p><b>Divisibility by 29<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;"> </span></b><br />Add 3 times the last digit to the remaining truncated number. Repeat the step as necessary. If the result is divisible by 29, the original number is also divisible by 29.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;"> </span><br /><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;"><br /></span><br /><b>Divisibility by 31</b><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;"> </span><br />Subtract 3 times the last digit from remaining truncated number. Repeat the step as necessary. If the result is divisible by 31, the original number is also divisible by 31<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre;"> </span><br />Check for 49507 =4950-(3*7)=4929 =492-(3*9) =465 =46-(3*5)=31. Hence 49507 is divisible by 31.</div>
