<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Without fun it is very difficult to stay in this world. We can all do lot of funny things with the help of this we can have lot fun based apps. The common bricks in this section are as follows
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"></div>
<ul /><a href="http://technorulerin.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/e58dc-fun.png" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/e58dc-fun.png" height="320" width="193" /></a>
<li style="text-align:left;">Cowbell</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Fireworks</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Hot Potato</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Jazz Hands</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Kick Drum</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Metonome</li>
<li style="text-align:left;">Snare Drum</li>
<p><b>Cow bell</b><br />It is used to produce the sound of the cow bell. We can also increase the Volume and can also change the background color and the color of the Cow bell.</p>
<p><b>Fire works</b><br />It is used to produce the fireworks sounds. We can set the number of rockets which has to be shown, then we can give the input to shoot the rockets and also we can give the type of the sound with which the rocket should blast.</p>
<p><b>Hot Potato</b><br />It is widely used for sending the signals at a random time between two number, we will set the maximum and minimum number, between that the signals are sent.</p>
<p>JazzHands<br />It is used to show the hand movement effect. We can give 3 types of input for this, either we can make both hands to shake, or only right hand or only left hand. We can also change the background color of the picture.</p>
<p>Kick Drum<br />It is very similar to the cow bell. But the only major difference between both is here we will be producing the drum sound which is produced when we kick on drum there we will have cow bell sound.</p>
<p>Metronome<br />Already we have seen about Metronome in one of our <a href="http://technoruler.blogspot.in/2014/07/basic-bricks-in-mozilla-appmaker-for.html" target="_blank">previous post.</a></p>
<p>Snare Drum<br />It is very similar to the Kick Drum. But the only major difference between both is here we will be producing the drum sound which is produced when we hit on drum there we kick on drum.</p>
