<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Whenever we heard a word App our love towards mobile gets started to increase to very high level. Now Firefox has started again an online contest called App of the Month for Firefox Students Ambassador.</p>
<p>We have heard  a  lot of Firefox OS and currently it is one of the top trending Mobile OS in the world. Recently it has been released in India and has seen massive success.</p>
<p>Developing apps for Firefox OS is very simple, it is just with the help of HTML5, Javascript and CSS3. We can also develop apps with the help of the Mozilla Appmaker tool. It is always interesting to develop more apps. In upcoming post you can learn more about developing apps with the  help of API's.<br />

<p>Each and every month Firefox Student Ambassador team is working on different theme which will be helping lot of students to think apps in different perspective. For the month of September it is <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/StudentAmbassadors/Activities/AppoftheMonth#September" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Educational Games</a>.</p>
<p>We all know Education is Key for Success, and we all know Gaming brings fun to all of us. Keeping this is mind students will have to develop some of the interesting apps which will be teaching others in Gamified Manner.</p>
