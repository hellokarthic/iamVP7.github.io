<p>Recently we are see some of the post on how to develop a website using github pages. We saw  list of the followings in the perspective of github</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2015/07/08/creating-github-account/" target="_blank">creating github account</a></li>
<li><a href="https://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2015/07/08/creating-github-website/" target="_blank">Creating Github website</a></li>
<li><a href="https://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2015/07/14/cloning-the-source-from-github-to-local-machine/" target="_blank">How to clone your repo to our machine</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In <a href="https://technorulerin.wordpress.com/firefox-os/" target="_blank">Firefox OS</a> app development point of view we have really a large number of tutorials. Which is available in the <a href="https://technorulerin.wordpress.com/firefox-os/" target="_blank">page</a></p>
<p>Very recently I have share a tutorial about getting started to <a href="https://viswaprasathks.wordpress.com/2015/08/16/online-firefox-os-app-development-introduction/" target="_blank">Firefox OS app development</a>. It is recommended to to check about it. The session is very small and you can learn very quickly.</p>
<p>First you have to create a small file in the folder where you have your website. Name the file as <em><strong>"manifest.webapp"</strong></em></p>
<p>In that file you have to give the following lines</p>
<blockquote><p>{<br />
"name": "MozillaTN",<br />
"description": "Mozilla Tamilnadu Website",<br />
"launch_path": "/index.html",<br />
"icons": {<br />
"512": "/icons/icon512x512.png",<br />
"256": "/icons/icon256x256.png",<br />
"64": "/icons/icon64x64.png",<br />
"128": "/icons/icon128x128.png"<br />
},<br />
"developer": {<br />
"name": "Mozilla Tamilnadu",<br />
"url": "http://mozillatn.github.io/"<br />
}<br />
}</p></blockquote>
<p>detailed info of each key</p>
<ul>
<li>"name" is the application name. It should be less than 12 characters.</li>
<li>"description" is where we have to tell about the application. It is good practice to have 25+ words and 50-</li>
<li>"launch_path" we have to mention which is going to be our first page when the app is launched.</li>
<li>"icons": this is the parent key which will have set of icons
<ul>
<li>"512": is we have to give the location of the icon of size 512x512 px.</li>
<li>"128": is we have to give the location of the icon of size 128X128 px.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"developer": will be having most of the information about the developer
<ul>
<li>"name" : we have to give developer name</li>
<li>"url": we can give the presonal website</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Save the file in the same folder where all your website contents like index.html, css files and js files are there.</p>
<p>The next step is just open <a href="https://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2014/11/11/get-started-with-mozillas-webide/" target="_blank">WebIDE</a></p>
<p>You  have to open the project. (Project -&gt; Open packaged app)</p>
<p>You have to open the folder of your application. You can see it is valid. If it is invalid, then have to check any problem in manifest file.</p>
<p>Then you can zip all the contest and upload to the marketplace. Your app is done.</p>
