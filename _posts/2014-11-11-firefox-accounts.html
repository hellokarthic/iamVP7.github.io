<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">Recently Firefox Marketplace developers might have got the mails to update to Firefox Accounts.
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://technorulerin.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/f1f5d-firefox2bacc.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/f1f5d-firefox2bacc.png?w=297" width="316" /></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>It is one of the interesting update as Far as I know. It has lot of benefits for Firefox OS app user, developers, Firefox OS apps developers.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><b>For Firefox Browser Users</b></div>
<div>Currently Firefox has provided an option to sync our bookmarks between Firefox browsers of two different devices. It will be very helpful with the Firefox Accounts.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In Future we can see Video calling service between our friends which will be using the Firefox accounts. On the recent <a href="http://www.technoruler.com/2014/11/firefox-introduced-developer-edition-of.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Firefox Developer browser</a> release we can easily see this Video calling feature in beta version.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>For Firefox OS app Users</b></div>
<div>We can keep track of the apps we have install so it will be helpful for us to install the apps which we had in our previous Firefox OS device.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If we lose our device we can easily locate them in the maps.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Note if you use same persona mail ID for Firefox accounts also it will be easily transfer all contents to Firefox Accounts.</div>
