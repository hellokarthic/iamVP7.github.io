<p>Panasonic has partnered with Mozilla a year ago to bring Linux based Firefox OS  to TV's. The hard work and the dream came true during this event, Panasonic team are very excited to released this awesome 4K HD display TV. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=midsZK1Q0RU">Giagom</a> had opportunity to capture the working TV at CES.</p>
<p>Previously Firefox OS had the opportunity to bring similar to Chromecast with the help of <a title="Matchstick is a Firefox OS based HDMI TV" href="http://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2014/10/11/matchstick-is-a-firefox-os-based-hdmi-tv/">Matchstick</a> which is having both open hardware and open software.</p>
<p>“We’ve made it easy to find your favorite content and applications or customize the user interface on our Life+ Screen 4K Ultra HD Smart TVs, powered by Firefox OS,” said Yuki Kusumi, Director of the Home Entertainment Business Division of Appliances Company of Panasonic. “Firefox OS uses open Web technologies, which allow us to maximize compatibility with other devices like smartphones and laptops to send content (such as your favorite photos or videos) to your TV.”</p>
<p>Before it was only for Mobile devices, then came Matchstick and now 4K HD Panasonic TV and next is Firefox OS based watch and then also consumer device. It is possible only with One  web.</p>
