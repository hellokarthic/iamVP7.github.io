<p>In our previous post we have seen how to <a href="https://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2015/03/22/enabling-find-my-firefox-device/" target="_blank">Enabling Find My Firefox Device</a> and now we can see how to find our device using the website.</p>
<p>Then we can easily find our device from <a href="https://find.firefox.com/" target="_blank">Find My Device Website</a> . First we have to visit the website, if we you have not previously created the <a href="https://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2014/11/12/signing-up-for-firefox-accounts/" target="_blank">Firefox Account in browser</a> we just need to create it. When we open our website it will look like below image.</p>

<p>Then we can sign in. We should use same mail ID in both our phone and in our website. We should have also internet connection enabled in our device for finding the application. Once we sign-in the browser will start searching our device. Once it found them it will be sharing the location in the map.</p>

<p><em>Ringing Feature</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The default ring tone which you have set will be heared.</li>
</ul>
<p>Locking Feature</p>
<ul>
<li>When we try to lock the device first it will ask for the simple.</li>
<li>Then it will ask for the passcode which we need to give for opening the device.</li>
<li>We then again have to conform the passcode.</li>
<li>The information which we gave will be displayed in the home screen.</li>
<li>When we try to scroll on unlocking it will ask for passcode. Once we give correct passcode it will get unlocked. And we can use our device.</li>
</ul>
<p>Erase</p>
<ul>
<li>We can also erase the data in our mobile phone, we cannot recover once we erase.</li>
</ul>
<p>This Find My device feature is really a amazing feature we have in our device. Which will protect our device from theft. It is so awesome to use.</p>
