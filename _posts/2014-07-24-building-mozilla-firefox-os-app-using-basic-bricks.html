<div dir="ltr" style="text-align:left;">
<div style="text-align:justify;">In our <a href="http://technoruler.blogspot.in/2014/07/basic-bricks-in-mozilla-appmaker-for.html" target="_blank">Basic Bricks in the Mozilla Appmaker for Firefox OS Mobile Apps</a> post we have been discussing about various basic bricks available for the Firefox OS application development. In this post we would like to make use of them so that we can experiment what we can do with the basic bricks. If you would like to know about the basic bricks check previous post.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://technorulerin.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/a95a0-app.png" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/a95a0-app.png" height="301" width="320" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">In this post we would like to develop a simple Mozilla Love application. Which is developed with lot of love and passion. It will be great if you like to remix the application according to your need. We would like to go Step by step for developing the application.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">First we would like to place<b> Header</b> component. After Placing the Header would like to change the Label as Love. Just click on the header and see the property will come on the right side, click there and edit.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">After that I would like to place the <b>Image</b> component. The default height with 160px you can also change it, and dont forget give the source of the Image.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">After that is the <b>Text</b> component. As of now I will wont be having any text and it will be blank. The alignment is made a center or left according to your wish. Increase or decrease the text size as you need and also the color.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Below the Text Component I would like to place the <b>Counter</b>. Which will be increasing the count whenever it gets the signal. The unit is declared as time by me. And the increment value is given as 1.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Then below them is a <b>Button</b>. Where I am giving Color of the text in White and the button color as red. Then the  Board cast value as "The above say's I Love Mozilla". So when I click the button it will be setting the text value as given above. </div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Below button is the <b>Metronome</b> which will be giving the periodic signals. The output of this signals are feed to the counter. I have set as 60 signals per minute. And made it to Autostart. So when the page is loaded it will be starting to give the signals.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">So when the page loads, the Metronome will be starting itself and the counter value will be keep on increase. When the Button is click a text will be appearing on the text box saying  "The above say's I Love Mozilla". </div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">You can find the application <a href="https://watery-sleet-724.webmak.es/app" target="_blank">here</a> and start remix.</div>
