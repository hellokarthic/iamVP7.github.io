<p>Recently we have seen how the <a title="Firefox OS moving to bigger screens" href="http://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2015/01/10/firefox-os-moving-to-bigger-screens/" target="_blank">Firefox OS is available in very big screens</a>. Now we can also see how it will be covering the future of consumer Electronics. Firefox OS is made for all screen.</p>
<p>In 2014 we have seen Google's Android based smart watch and the module to develop apps has been integrated in the <a title="Android Studio" href="http://technorulerin.wordpress.com/2013/05/16/android-studio/" target="_blank">Android Studio</a> beta to help developers in Google IO and Apple's iOS based Apple watch in WWDC, it is estimated that in 2015 there will be launch of WebOS based. At this time Firefox has shown just the basic prototype how it's watch will be. Â In the Consumer Electronics Show 2015 Mozilla team has shown the prototype of Firefox OS based watch.It is very exciting to see the prototype we have seen in the Youtube video.</p>

<p>There was another interesting scene in the video where there was a integration of Firefox OS in Washing machine and controlling the various processes of washing machine from the watch itself.</p>
